/* 
For this solution, you can create a custom Comparable class that compares
the first two letters and the order in which they came in (this solution
represents that with the variable "index") if the first two letters are
the same. I create a Person array and keep track of their order as I read
in the names. Afterwards, use Arrays.sort() to sort it, and loop through the
array and print out their names.
Alternatively, you could use a TreeSet instead of an array since there
are no duplicate names, and the TreeSet will naturally sort it. This way
you could just loop through the TreeSet and print out the names.
